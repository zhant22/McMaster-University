********************Lab4 marking scheme***********************
Total: 100 marks (5% of the total course mark.)
Bonus: 10 marks  (0.5% of the total course mark.)
Overall: 110 marks

Demo - 70 marks:  Linear Probing (35)+ Quadratic Probing (35)

Marks Distribition for Demo:
(1-5) Tests for Linear Probing (26)

(6-10) Tests for Quadratic Probing (26)

11)  Test 11-Probing Simulations for Linear Probing Hash Table (9) 
12)  Test 12-Probing Simulations for Quadratic Probing Hash Table  (9)

Instruction: 

1. The test class "TestHashTable.java" automatically checks and sums up total marks for tests 1-13.
2.Please add the get methods relevant to the table (max load factor, number of keys, table size, etc.)in your HashTableLin.java and HashTableQuad.java files
 in order to run the TestHashTable.java file. 
3. Table size should be prime with no duplicate. To find the next prime number, it is ok to use a library.
    

Note: 
1. In test 11, students provide both experimetal and theoritical values of avg. no. of probes for successful search for each λ = 0.1, 0.2, · · · , 0.9 using Linear Probing. 
The test class automatically checks and compare the experimental values with the theoretical values (TV). The test class allows a max difference of ~(.1*TV) to pass.
2. For test 12 students are supposed to provide experimental values of avg. no. of probes for successful search for each λ = 0.1, 0.2, · · · , 0.9 using Quadratic Probing. For better comparison 
an estimation of # probes is calculated for each λ. The test class automatically checks and compare the experimental value with this estimated value (EV).  The test class allows a max difference of ~(.1*EV) 
to pass.
3. TAs will check and compare output of KeysAndIndexes during demo at the end of each test (1-10).

Question/Answer- 10 marks 
//(5 for each type of probing)

Runtime and Space complexity- 10 marks 
//(5 for each type of probing)
//The students should show run time and space complexity for all methods they wrote for this lab.  

All fields private - 10 marks 
//(5 for each type of probing)
//includes a field named table, of type Integer[], and other fields: size of the table, the number of keys stored in the table and the load factor etc.


BONUS - 10 marks
For the bonus - Test 13 
//Comment out the bonus part if students don't have it. 
1 mark for the method, 1 mark for result for each  λ
//Students must change the method's name with their own to run the bonus part. 
//Students must provide both experimetal and theoretical values of avg. no. of probes for unsuccessful search for each λ = 0.1, 0.2, · · · , 0.9 using Linear probing. 
The test class automatically checks and compare the experimental values with the theoretical values (TV). The test class allows a max difference of ~(.1*TV) to pass.
